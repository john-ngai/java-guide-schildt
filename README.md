## Environment Requirements

- JDK 17
- IntelliJ IDEA

## Getting Started

All the code from this project can be compiled and ran via the tools provided by the JDK.

To compile the Java code into bytecode, run the `javac` command. For example,

```shell
javac ClassName.java
```

If successfully compiled, a matching `.class` file will be generated.

To run this file within the JVM, use the `java` command. For example,

```shell
# If the file name is ClassName.class
java ClassName
```
